# Cost of History Collection

- time: controlled by the parameter `collection-time`, e.g., a collection time of 100s will cause a collection process that lasts for 100 seconds, without the additional setup and cooldown cost that is not actively monitored
- memory: in line with the VirtualBox default settings that regulate the memory space and WAL buffer restrictions that control the validity of WAL collection
